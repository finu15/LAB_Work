<b>Television is one of the many wonders of modern science and technology.</b> <i> It was invented in England by the Scottish scientist J.N.</i> <u> Baird in 1928 and the British Broadcasting Corporation was the first to broadcast television images in 1929.</u> <strike> Previously the radio helped us hear things from far and near.</strike> spread information and knowledge from one corner of the globe to another. But all this was done through sound only. But television combined visual images with sound. Today we can watch games, shows, and song and dance programs from all corners of the world while sitting in our own homes. TV can be used for educating the masses, for bringing to us the latest pieces of information audio-visually and can provide us with all kinds of entertainment even in colour. But as in all things, too much televiewing may prove harmful. In many cases, the habit of watching TV has an adverse effect on the study habits of the young. When we read books, we have to use our intelligence and imagination. But in most cases, TV watching is a passive thing. It may dull our imagination and intelligence.
